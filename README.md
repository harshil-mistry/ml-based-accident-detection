This was the project we made in the Techathon 2025 at Adani Institute of Digital Technology Management. Our theme was on Road Safety. And the main motive of this project was that we will pass the CCTV footage alongside roads to out model which will try to detect accidents in that footage. If any such accident is detected, then the higher authorities will be informed about the accident and the emergency services will be updated, reducing the First Aid help time by a large margin. 

There were some additional features as well in the website, such as the user can see the weather conditions or traffic in the city, so the user can take precautions beforehand and can take the route which will help the user reach the destination easily and quicker.

Although by the end of given time period, we were not able to integrate these two components (model and website), as of now both are working fine individually, and i am too lazy to integrate the model in the website :)
